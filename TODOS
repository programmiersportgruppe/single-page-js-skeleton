# TODOS
- problem: we are testing with different code (npm install) than what we are using (assets)
  * the assets assume window/navigator/etc exist
  * we can use jsdom to mock those
  * but then the require logic needs to be monkey-patched
- problem: sammy.js depends on the jQuery global variable instead of taking in a dependency
- lazy init of a new view
- the user is sometimes signed out after signing up -- one needs to login again

# QUESTIONS
- how does Rails' compilation of assets work? Is it compatible with AMD JS modules?
