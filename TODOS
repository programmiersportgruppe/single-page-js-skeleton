# TODOS
- problem: we are testing with different code (npm install) than what we are using (assets)
  * the assets assume window/navigator/etc exist
  * we can use jsdom to mock those
  * but then the require logic needs to be monkey-patched
- problem: sammy.js depends on the jQuery global variable instead of taking in a dependency
- lazy init of a new view
- how to hide components until knockout has parsed them

# QUESTIONS
- do we really need i18n on the JS side?
- is Rails useful as the JS server
- how to do the alert/notice with a timeout knockout-like
- how to refresh todos when user logs in knockout-style?
