# TODOS
- problem: we are testing with different code (npm install) than what we are using (assets)
- problem: not sure how to run the javascript tests in the browser
- problem: sammy.js depends on the jQuery global variable instead of taking in a dependency
- lazy init of a new view
- how to hide components until knockout has parsed them

# QUESTIONS
- do we really need i18n on the JS side?
- is Rails useful as the JS server
- how to do the alert/notice with a timeout knockout-like
- how to refresh todos when user logs in knockout-style?
